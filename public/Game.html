		<p>Journey into Canis Major Dwarf. Trade Resources. Manufacture Stuff. Stay Lit.</p>
		<div class="top-nav">Intention | Game Generated Art Brokerage | Community | Account </div>
		<p>Thanks to early access testers. Things I'm aware of: inexistent, destitute game art, lazy camera when too far, lack of website responsiveness for mobile and other devices. Probably a bug or two related to destroying trees. I'm sorry for the poor music.</p><br>
		<h5>Manual Instructions</h5>
		<ul style="text-align: start; margin-left: 50px; font-size: 0.75em;">
			<li>Controls: Left click on terrain to move there.</li>
			<li>Camera: Mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Hold left click and pan to rotate. Both buttons to do both at the same time. (MAJOR UPDATE TO 'CAMERA FOLLOW' UPCOMING)</li>
			<li>Character: Left click on a resource (i.e., a tree) to open the action context menu.</li>
			<li>Character: Left click on a resource in inventory (i.e, wood) to open the inventory context menu. Only 'Trade to Broker' is implemented so far.</li>
			<li>Character: Left click on a resource in brokerage (i.e, wood) to open the brokerage context menu. Click on a seller's ID to buy their stuff.</li>
			<li>Economy: An item's valuation will fluctuate depending on economics laws and free market fluctuations, based on supply and demand. (Not implemented yet)</li>
			<li>Events: Special resources like trees (and other stuff like chickens and peanuts) spawn at a fixed interval depending on what resources are left. Access to these resources will be determined by luck and a player's proximity to the spawn point. (Not implemented yet)</li>
			<li>Goals: Find lost crabs and souls (Not implemented yet). Manufacture items that can become art pieces in the brokerage gallery. Players will be able to trade and buy your manufactured items and alter them for an in-game price. (Not implemented yet). Complete the narrative. Explore the planet's dungeon and get to floor 100 by keeping your lantern oil up. Keep your lantern oil up by consuming resources and influence global darkness by trading with players without access to special resources (Not implemented yet).</li>
			<li>Other Players: Try to help other people and see what happens</li>
		</ul>

				<h1>Story So Far</h1><br>
				<p>The planet's surface is dark and almost silent. Your cart's wheels make a creepy sound that sends a twinge up your spine. Heck, even your own shadow startles you. A pair of little squirrels stare anyway. They vanish in the forest, as if they had just remembered something important to do.</p><br>
				<p>This was not the agreed upon plan. The <strong>Space Colonization Bureau</strong> had reassured you that this exoplanet was the closest candidate to Earth's last known condition in <strong>Canis Major Dwarf</strong>, but nothing around you seems familiar. Why are you even a cart and not a body? (You hear a voice thundering from above: "Cause I don't know how to animate you, man.") Unfortunately, you lost sight of the rest of the crew after landing. You check your radio: its <strong>aluminium and steel material</strong> is badly damaged from the landing. You also check the most vital asset in your equipment: your <strong><span style="color: orange;">Exploration Lantern of Light</span></strong>. 
					Miraculously, it has been undamaged from the landing. Without it, you cannot continue on, you recall from your Space Colonization Training. <strong>Dangerous exo-lifeforms known from previous explorers</strong> have been known to prey on those without their <strong><span style="color: orange;">Light</span></strong>. Keep your Exploration Lantern of Light filled with any <strong><span style="color: green;">consummable resource</span></strong> you can find.<br><br>Time is critical: <strong><span style="color: blue;">find a way to repair your radio comms.</span></strong></p>
					<p>Pre-Alpha Developer's Notice: You can't finish this first mission yet. I need to finish my courses at school first, become a legend, AND make my mom proud. (BlahblahIWouldAppreciateMoneyBlah.) - Love You Greatly</p>
